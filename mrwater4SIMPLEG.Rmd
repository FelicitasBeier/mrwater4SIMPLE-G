## Introduction
Here, we assess the data from mrwater for an analysis of environmental flow protection with SIMPLE-G. 
We further prepare all mrwater output data for further processing in SIMPLE-G.
The first part of this document visualizes the outputs from mrwater at gridded level. 
The second part processes the data to derive elasticities for SIMPLE-G and transforms the data to netcdf files. 

```{r ReadData, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Environmental Flow Requirements (as share of discharge that has to stay in the river)
EFRshare <- collapseNames(read.magpie(paste0(inputdatapath, "EFRshare.mz"))[, , "EFR"])

# Current cropland area

cropmix_ir  <- read.magpie(paste0(inputdatapath, "cropmix_ir.mz"))
cropmix_tot <- read.magpie(paste0(inputdatapath, "cropmix_tot.mz"))
croplist    <- getItems(croparea_rf, dim = "crop")

# check:

# Potentially irrigated area (on current cropland)
PIA_CUR   <- collapseNames(read.magpie(paste0(inputdatapath, "PIA_CUR.mz"))[, , scenario])

```

## Environmental Flow Requirements
In the version/setting of mrwater that was used for this analysis, environmental flow requirements are calculated based on the the Variable Month Flow (VMF) Method following Pastor et al. (2014).

The following graph shows the share of discharge per grid cell around the year 2010 that has to be reserved for the environment to keep aquatic and riverine ecosystems in a fair condition. The value ranges between 30% and 40% of discharge to be preserved for the environment.

```{r plotEFRShare, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
legendtitle  <- "Share of discharge"
legendlimit  <- c(0.3, 0.4)
legendbreaks <- seq(0.3, 0.4, 0.02)
legendcolor  <- brewer.pal(length(legendbreaks)-1, "Greens")

# Share fulfilled with local water resources
plotMap(x = EFRshare,
        name = "EFRshr",
        title = paste0("Share of Discharge that has to be preserved for the Environment"),
        outputfolder = outputdatapath,
        ylim = ylim, xlim = xlim,
        legendcolor = legendcolor, colNA = colNA,
        legendlimit = legendlimit, legendbreaks = legendbreaks,
        legendname = legendtitle)

```
```{r EFRshrPlotDisplay, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Share of Discharge that has to be reserved for the Environment", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(outputdatapath, "\\EFRshr.png"))
```

This is the underlying data that we want to apply as shock to SIMPLE-G. It indirectly affects the price elasticity of surface water through a reduction of potential irrigation water withdrawals (PIWW), i.e. the asymptode of the surface water supply function. 

Not every location would be affected by the water limitation because many areas have plenty of water available that could be used for irrigation without violating environmental flows. However, in some local hotspots water withdrawals would have to be reduced to maintain a functioning acquatic and riverine ecosystem. 

Here are summary statistics on gridded PIWW (in mio. m3): 
```{r summaryPIWW, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
print("Without environmental flow protection:")
summary(PIWW_CUR[, , "off"])
print("With environmental flow protection:")
summary(PIWW_CUR[, , "on"])
```
```{r plotPIWW, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
min <- min(PIWW_CUR)
max <- floor(max(PIWW_CUR/1000))*1000
legendlimit  <- c(min, max)
legendbreaks <- seq(min, max, max/8)
legendcolor  <- brewer.pal(length(legendbreaks)-1, "Blues")

# PIWW_CUR given in mio. m^3
plotMap(x = PIWW_CUR[, , "off"],
        name = "PIWW_off",
        title = paste0("Potential Irrigation Water Withdrawal"),
        outputfolder = outputdatapath,
        ylim = ylim, xlim = xlim,
        legendcolor = legendcolor, colNA = colNA,
        legendlimit = legendlimit, legendbreaks = legendbreaks,
        legendname = "m3")

# PIWW_CUR given in mio. m^3
plotMap(x = PIWW_CUR[, , "on"],
        name = "PIWW_on",
        title = paste0("Potential Irrigation Water Withdrawal under EFP"),
        outputfolder = outputdatapath,
        ylim = ylim, xlim = xlim,
        legendcolor = legendcolor, colNA = colNA,
        legendlimit = legendlimit, legendbreaks = legendbreaks,
        legendname = "m3")


# Reduction in PIWW through EFP (in terms of m3)
diff <- PIWW_CUR[, , "on"] - PIWW_CUR[, , "off"]
diff[diff == 0] <- NA

min <- -200
max <- 200
legendlimit  <- c(min, max)
legendbreaks <- seq(min, max, max/4)
legendcolor  <- brewer.pal(length(legendbreaks)-1, "RdYlBu")

plotMap(x = diff,
        name = "changeEFP",
        title = paste0("Change in Water Availability through EFP"),
        outputfolder = outputdatapath,
        ylim = ylim, xlim = xlim,
        legendcolor = legendcolor, colNA = colNA,
        legendlimit = legendlimit, legendbreaks = legendbreaks,
        legendname = "m3")

print(paste0("Globally, potential irrigation water withdrawals would decrease by ", (-1) * round(sum(diff, na.rm = TRUE) / 1000), "km3"))

# Make graph with current violations
# (where today's use is > max. PIWW under EFP)

summary(PIWW_CUR[, , "off"] - PIWW_IRR)
summary(PIWW_CUR[, , "on"] - PIWW_IRR)


violations <- PIWW_CUR[, , "on"] - PIWW_IRR
violations[violations > 0] <- 0
violations[violations == 0] <- NA
plotmap2(toolLPJarrayToMAgPIEmap(violations))

isViolated <- violations
isViolated[isViolated < 0] <- 1
plotmap2(toolLPJarrayToMAgPIEmap(isViolated), midcol = "darkred")

```

The following two maps visualize the volume of PIWW for the two scenarios: 

```{r PIWWoff, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Potential Irrigation Water Withdrawal (without EFP)", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(outputdatapath, "\\PIWW_off.png"))
```

```{r PIWWon, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Potential Irrigation Water Withdrawal (with EFP)", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(outputdatapath, "\\PIWW_on.png"))
```

Note to Iman: These two could be inserted as different asymptodes in SIMPLE-G. 

The difference between the two scenarios (reflecting the change in the maximum water withdrawal volume) is shown in the following figure: 

```{r changeEFP, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Change in PIWW through EFP", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(outputdatapath, "\\changeEFP.png"))
```


For SIMPLE-G, the EFP shock is calculated as the difference of PIWW under environmental flow protection and PIWW without limits on withdrawals as a percentage change. 

```{r EFPshock, include = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
efpShock <- ifelse(PIWW_CUR[, , "off"] > 0, 
                     (PIWW_CUR[, , "on"] - PIWW_CUR[, , "off"]) / PIWW_CUR[, , "off"] * 100,
                   0)
efpShock[efpShock > 100] <- 100
```

Note: Some areas see an extreme (up to 52577%) increase in PIWW. I have capped them to 100% (for visualization purposes). These are areas where under no protection, no water comes through anymore, so nothing can be used. Should it be capped at a different value/ not capped at all for the SIMPLE-G analysis?

```{r EFPshockPlot, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
min <- -100
max <- 100
legendlimit  <- c(min, max)
legendbreaks <- seq(min, max, max/4)
legendcolor  <- brewer.pal(length(legendbreaks)-1, "RdBu")

# For visualization: locations where there is no change are set to NA
efpShock[efpShock == 0] <- NA

plotMap(x = efpShock,
        name = "efpShock",
        title = paste0("Percentage Change in PIWW through EFP"),
        outputfolder = outputdatapath,
        ylim = ylim, xlim = xlim,
        legendcolor = legendcolor, colNA = colNA,
        legendlimit = legendlimit, legendbreaks = legendbreaks,
        legendname = "")
```

The percentage change is displayed here: 
```{r PercChangeEFP, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Percentage Change in PIWW through EFP", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(outputdatapath, "\\efpShock.png"))
```


## Price Elasticity of Surface Water

We derive the price elasticity of surface water using PIWW on current cropland (without environmental flow protection), i.e. the maximum volume of surface water that can be withdrawn in a certain grid cell and the current withdrawal for irrigation using the following formula:
```{r SurfaceWaterEquation, include = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Surface water elasticity (without protection)
epsilonOFF <- 1 - (PIWW_IRR / PIWW_CUR[, , "off"])
```
Values of 0 indicate that there is no further potential to withdraw more water beyond the current level (perfectly inelastic). Values of 1 indicate that plenty of water is still available and more water can be used.
The following graph visualizes the values on a global map:
```{r SurfaceWaterPlot, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Plot SWElasiticity 
min <- 0
max <- 1
legendlimit  <- c(min, max)
legendbreaks <- seq(min, max, max/8)
legendcolor  <- rev(brewer.pal(length(legendbreaks)-1, "Purples")) # RdYlBu YlOrRd

plotMap(x = epsilonOFF,
        name = "swElasticityOFF",
        title = paste0("Surface Water Elasticity"),
        outputfolder = outputdatapath,
        ylim = ylim, xlim = xlim,
        legendcolor = legendcolor, colNA = colNA,
        legendlimit = legendlimit, legendbreaks = legendbreaks,
        legendname = "")
```
```{r SWelasticityPlotBaseline, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Surface Water Elasticity (Baseline)", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(outputdatapath, "\\swElasticityOFF.png"))
```

The price elasticity changes when water withdrawals are restricted in line with Environmental Flow Protection (EFP). 

```{r SurfaceWaterPlotEFP, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Surface water elasticity
epsilonON <- 1 - (PIWW_IRR / PIWW_CUR[, , "on"])
# Plot SWElasiticity 
min <- 0
max <- 1
legendlimit  <- c(min, max)
legendbreaks <- seq(min, max, max/8)
legendcolor  <- rev(brewer.pal(length(legendbreaks)-1, "Purples")) # RdYlBu YlOrRd

plotMap(x = epsilonON,
        name = "swElasticityON",
        title = paste0("Surface Water Elasticity"),
        outputfolder = outputdatapath,
        ylim = ylim, xlim = xlim,
        legendcolor = legendcolor, colNA = colNA,
        legendlimit = legendlimit, legendbreaks = legendbreaks,
        legendname = "")
```

```{r SWelasticityPlotEFP, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Surface Water Elasticity (EFP Scenario)", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(outputdatapath, "\\swElasticityON.png"))
```


## Transformation Elasticity of Rainfed to Irrigated Land

The proxy for the gridded transformation elasticity of rainfed to irrigated land should give an indication of how easy it is to transform rainfed to irrigated area.
This depends on both the distance of the currently irrigated area to the maximum potentially irrigated area as well as on the yield gain through irrigation. 

Note: Include calculation and visualization here.

```{r TransformationElasticity, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

((PIA_CUR[, , "off"] - PIA_IRR) * cropmix_rf) * (yld_ir - yld_rf) / yld_rf * croparea_rf

tau <- PIA_IRR / PIA_CUR[, , "off"]
plotmap2(toolLPJarrayToMAgPIEmap(tau), title = "Transformation Elasticity",
         sea = FALSE)

```


## Generation of Inputs for SIMPLE-G

The main outputs for a first analysis are: 

* surface water elasticity for baseline case (`swElasticity.nc`)
* environmental flow policy shock as percentage change (note: capped) (`efpShockpc.nc`)

The secondary outputs (depending on how we choose to implement it) are: 

* surface water elasticity for environmental flow protection case (`swElasticityEFP.nc`)
* the asymptode (maximum) for the two scenarios (`PIWW.nc` and `PIWWefp.nc`)
* current irrigation water withdrawal (`currentWW.nc`)


```{r outputs4SIMPLEG, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Surface Water Elasticity 
write.magpie(epsilonOFF, file_name = paste0(outputdatapath,  "swElasticity.nc"))
write.magpie(epsilonON, file_name = paste0(outputdatapath, "swElasticityEFP.nc"))

# Environmental Flow Protection Shock 
# (percentage change of PIWW caused by EFP)
write.magpie(efpShock, file_name = paste0(outputdatapath, "efpShockpc.nc"))

# Current withdrawals
write.magpie(PIWW_IRR, file_name = paste0(outputdatapath, "currentWW.nc"))

# Potential withdrawals
write.magpie(PIWW_CUR[, , "off"], file_name = paste0(outputdatapath, "PIWW.nc"))
write.magpie(PIWW_CUR[, , "on"], file_name = paste0(outputdatapath, "PIWWefp.nc"))

```
