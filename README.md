# mrwater4SIMPLE-G
This repository provides the pipeline of preparing data
provided by the mrwater hydro-economic irrigation water allocation algorithm
to SIMPLE-G.

It contains the script that can be run to create irrigation potentials by mrwater
as well as an Rmd file doing further processing to derive gridded surface water elasticities
and gridded transformation elasticities between irrigated and rainfed land.
